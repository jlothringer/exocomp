`Many different retrieval codes exist <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023RNAAS...7...54M/abstract>`__, each with different methods for quantifying atmospheric compositions. In general, chemical equilibrium retrievals quote a metallicity and C/O, but the way in which these are defined varies. For some codes, metallicity is parameterized by O/H, while C/O adjusts the C/H ratio. But in other codes, it is the opposite!

Exocomp is a toolkit with functions and utilities for normalizing measurements from different retrievals of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Features include:

* Conversions between volume mixing ratio and mass fraction (and vice versa).
* Conversions in bulk abundances between different definitions of solar composition (or between defintiions of host star abundances).
* Conversions from metallicity, C/O, and refractory-to-volatile ratios to elemental abundance ratios.
* Fitting of metallicity, C/O, and refractory-to-volatile ratios to sets of atomic and molecular abundances.

Available solar abundance defintions include:

* Lodders+ 2025
* Lodders+ 2020
* Lodders+ 2010
* Asplund+ 2021
* Asplund+ 2009
* Asplund+ 2005
* Caffau+ 2011
