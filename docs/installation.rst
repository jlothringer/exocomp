Installation
============

Consider doing installation in a proper conda environment.

Step 1: Install easyCHEM
____________________________

Install easyCHEM `here <https://easychem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

There are some gcc dependencies that mean you should install in yourself.

Step 2: Clone ExoComp
____________________________

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/jlothringer/exocomp.git


Step 3: Install
____________________________

.. code-block:: bash

   cd exocomp
   pip install -e .


Let me know if that doesn't work!
